# NYC-Taxis
In NYC, it’s very likely that one’s form of transportation will be in a yellow cab. Observing taxi traffic can provide city planners, citizens and taxi companies with information in diverse aspects, such as pricing, hourly and season patters, insights on where to direct taxi drivers and more.
We aim to analyze these aspects and draft a recommendation for city planners based on NYC taxi trip data that spans over several years.
